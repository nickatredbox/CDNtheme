								1.&nbsp; They create and pursue S.M.A.R.T. goals.</h3>
							<p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 15px; ">
								Successful people are objective.&nbsp; They have realistic targets in mind.&nbsp; 
								They know what they are looking for and why they are fighting for it.&nbsp; 
								Successful people create and pursue S.M.A.R.T. goals.</p>
							<p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 15px; ">
								S.M.A.R.T. goals are<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><strong

									style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; ">T</strong>imely.&nbsp; Let’s briefly 
								review each:</p>
							<ul style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 15px 40px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); list-style-type: square; ">
								<li style="padding: 3px 0px; margin: 0px; ">
									<strong style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; ">Specific</strong><span 
										class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>– A general goal would be, “Get in 
									shape.” But a related specific goal would be, “Join a health club and workout 3 
									days a week for the next<span id="more-409" style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; "></span>52 
									weeks.”&nbsp; A specific goal has a far greater chance of being accomplished because 
									it has defined parameters and constraints.</li>
								<li style="padding: 3px 0px; margin: 0px; ">
									<strong style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; ">Measurable</strong><span 
										class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>– There must be a logical system for 
									measuring the progress of a goal.&nbsp; To determine if your goal is measurable, ask 
									yourself questions like:&nbsp; How much time? How many total?&nbsp; How will I know when 
									the goal is accomplished? etc.&nbsp; When you measure your progress, you stay on 
									track, reach your target dates, and experience the exhilaration of achievement 
									that spurs you on to continued efforts required to reach your goal.</li>
								<li style="padding: 3px 0px; margin: 0px; ">
									<strong style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; ">Attainable<span 
										class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></strong>– To be attainable, a goal 
									must represent an objective toward which you are both willing and able to work.&nbsp; 
									In other words, the goal must be realistic.&nbsp; The big question here is:&nbsp; How can 
									the goal be accomplished?</li>
								<li style="padding: 3px 0px; margin: 0px; ">
									<strong style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; ">Relevant</strong><span 
										class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>– Relevance stresses the importance of 
									choosing goals that matter.&nbsp; For example, an internet entrepreneur’s goal to 
									“Make 75 tuna sandwiches by 2:00PM.” may be Specific, Measurable, Attainable, 
									and Timely, but lacks Relevance to an entrepreneurs overarching objective of 
									building a profitable online business.</li>
								<li style="padding: 3px 0px; margin: 0px; ">
									<strong style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; ">Timely</strong><span 
										class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>– A goal must be grounded within a 
									time frame, giving the goal a target date.&nbsp; A commitment to a deadline helps you 
									focus your efforts on the completion of the goal on or before the due date.&nbsp; 
									This part of the S.M.A.R.T. goal criteria is intended to prevent goals from 
									being overtaken by daily distractions.</li>
							</ul>
							<p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 15px; ">
								When you identify S.M.A.R.T. goals that are truly important to you, you become 
								motivated to figure out ways to attain them.&nbsp; You develop the necessary 
								attitude, abilities, and skills.&nbsp; You can achieve almost any goal you set 
								if you plan your steps wisely and establish a time frame that allows you to 
								carry out those steps.&nbsp; Goals that once seemed far away and out of reach 
								eventually move closer and become attainable, not because your goals shrink, but 
								because you grow and expand to match them.</p>

								2.&nbsp; They take decisive and immediate action.</h3>
							<p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 15px; ">
								Sadly, very few people ever live to become the success story they dream about.&nbsp; 
								And there’s one simple reason why:</p>
							<p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 15px; ">
								They never take action!</p>
							<p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 15px; ">
								The acquisition of knowledge doesn’t mean you’re growing.&nbsp; Growing happens 
								when what you know changes how you live.&nbsp;&nbsp; So many people live in a 
								complete daze.&nbsp; Actually, they don’t ‘live.’&nbsp; They simply ‘get by’ 
								because they never take the necessary action to make things happen – to seek 
								their dreams.</p>
							<p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 15px; ">
								It doesn’t matter if you have a genius IQ and a PhD in Quantum Physics, you 
								can’t change anything or make any sort of real-world progress without taking 
								action.&nbsp; There’s a huge difference between knowing how to do something and 
								actually doing it.&nbsp; Knowledge and intelligence are both useless without 
								action.&nbsp; It’s as simple as that.</p>
							<p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 15px; ">
								Success hinges on the simple act of making a decision to live – to absorb 
								yourself in the process of going after your dreams and goals.&nbsp; So make that 
								decision.&nbsp; And take action.&nbsp; For some practical guidance on taking 
								action I highly recommend<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><em

								things make no difference.&nbsp; Being busy is often a form of mental laziness – 
								lazy thinking and indiscriminate action.”&nbsp; This is Ferris’ way of saying 
								“work smarter, not harder,” which happens to be one of the most prevalent modern 
								day personal development clichés.&nbsp; But like most clichés, there’s a great 
								deal of truth to it, and few people actually adhere to it.</p>
							<p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 15px; ">
								Just take a quick look around.&nbsp; The busy outnumber the productive by a wide 
								margin.</p>
							<p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 15px; ">
								Busy people are rushing all over the place, and running late half of the time.&nbsp; 
								They’re heading to work, conferences, meetings, social engagements, etc.&nbsp; 
								They barely have enough free time for family get-togethers and they rarely get 
								enough sleep.&nbsp; Yet, business emails are shooting out of their smart phones 
								like machine gun bullets, and their daily planner is jammed to the brim with 
								obligations.</p>
							<p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 15px; ">
								Their busy schedule gives them an elevated sense of importance.&nbsp; But it’s 
								all an illusion.&nbsp; They’re like hamsters running on a wheel.</p>
							<p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 15px; ">
								The solution:&nbsp; Slow down.&nbsp; Breathe.&nbsp; Review your commitments and 
								goals.&nbsp;<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><strong 
									style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; ">Put first things first.</strong>&nbsp; 
								Do one thing at a time.&nbsp; Start now.&nbsp; Take a short break in two hours.&nbsp; 
								Repeat.</p>
							<p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 15px; ">
								And always remember, results are more important than the time it takes to 
								achieve them.</p>
							<h3 style="padding: 10px 0px 0px; margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-weight: normal; font-size: 1.5em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); line-height: normal; ">
								4.&nbsp; They make logical, informed decisions.</h3>
							<p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 15px; ">
								Sometimes we do things that are permanently foolish simply because we are 
								temporarily upset or excited.</p>
							<p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 15px; ">
								Although emotional ‘gut instincts’ are effective in certain fleeting situations, 
								when it comes to generating long-term, sustained growth in any area of life, 
								emotional decisions often lead a person astray.&nbsp; Decisions driven by heavy 
								emotion typically contain minimal amounts of conscious thought, and are 
								primarily based on momentary feelings instead of mindful awareness.</p>
							<p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 15px; ">
								The best advice here is simple:&nbsp; Don’t let your emotions trump your 
								intelligence.&nbsp; Slow down and think things through before you make any 
								life-changing decisions.</p>
							<h3 style="padding: 10px 0px 0px; margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-weight: normal; font-size: 1.5em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); line-height: normal; ">
								5.&nbsp; They avoid the trap of trying to make things perfect.</h3>
							<p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 15px; ">
								Many of us are perfectionists in our own right.&nbsp; I know I am at times.&nbsp; 
								We set high bars for ourselves and put our best foot forward.&nbsp; We dedicate 
								copious amounts of time and attention to our work to maintain our high personal 
								standards.&nbsp; Our passion for excellence drives us to run the extra mile, 
								never stopping, never relenting.&nbsp; And this dedication towards perfection 
								undoubtedly helps us achieve results…&nbsp; So long as we don’t get carried 
								away.</p>
							<p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 15px; ">
								But what happens when we do get carried away with perfectionism?</p>
							<p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 15px; ">
								We become disgruntled and discouraged when we fail to meet the (impossibly high) 
								standards we set for ourselves, making us reluctant to take on new challenges or 
								even finish tasks we’ve already started.&nbsp; Our insistence on dotting every 
								‘I’ and crossing every ‘T’ breeds inefficiency, causing major delays, stress 
								overload and subpar results.</p>
							<p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 15px; ">
								True perfectionists have a hard time starting things and an even harder time 
								finishing them, always.&nbsp; I have a friend who has wanted to start a graphic 
								design business for several years.&nbsp; But she hasn’t yet.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; 
								When you sift through her extensive list of excuses it comes down to one simple 
								problem:&nbsp; She is a perfectionist.&nbsp; Which means she doesn’t, and never 
								will, think she’s good enough at graphic design to own and operate her own 
								graphic design business.</p>
							<p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 15px; ">
								Remember, the real world doesn’t reward perfectionists.&nbsp; It rewards people 
								who get things done.&nbsp; And the only way to get things done is to be 
								imperfect 99% of the time.&nbsp; Only by wading through years of practice and 
								imperfection can we begin to achieve momentary glimpses of the perfection.&nbsp; 
								So make a decision.&nbsp; Take action, learn from the outcome, and repeat this 
								method over and over again in all walks of life.&nbsp; Also, check out<em

							<h3 style="padding: 10px 0px 0px; margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-weight: normal; font-size: 1.5em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); line-height: normal; ">
								6.&nbsp; They work outside of their comfort zone.</h3>
							<p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 15px; ">
								The number one thing I persistently see holding smart people back is their own 
								reluctance to accept an opportunity simply because they don’t think they’re 
								ready.&nbsp; In other words, they feel uncomfortable and believe they require 
								additional knowledge, skill, experience, etc. before they can aptly partake in 
								the opportunity.&nbsp; Sadly, this is the kind of thinking that stifles personal 
								growth and success.</p>
							<p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 15px; ">
								The truth is nobody ever feels 100% ready when an opportunity arises.&nbsp; 
								Because most great opportunities in life force us to grow emotionally and 
								intellectually.&nbsp; They force us to stretch ourselves and our comfort zones, 
								which means we won’t feel totally comfortable at first.&nbsp; And when we don’t 
								feel comfortable, we don’t feel ready.</p>
							<p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 15px; ">
								Significant moments of opportunity for personal growth and success will come and 
								go throughout your lifetime.&nbsp; If you are looking to make positive changes 
								and new breakthroughs in your life, you will need to embrace these moments of 
								opportunity even though you will never feel 100% ready for them.</p>
							<h3 style="padding: 10px 0px 0px; margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-weight: normal; font-size: 1.5em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); line-height: normal; ">
								7.&nbsp; They keep things simple.</h3>
							<p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 15px; ">
								Leonardo da Vinci once said, “Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.”&nbsp; 
								Nothing could be closer to the truth.&nbsp; Here in the 21st century, where 
								information moves at the speed of light and opportunities for innovation seem 
								endless, we have an abundant array of choices when it comes to designing our 
								lives and careers.&nbsp; But sadly, an abundance of choice often leads to 
								complication, confusion and inaction.</p>
							<p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 15px; ">
								Several business and marketing studies have shown that the more product choices 
								a consumer is faced with, the less products they typically buy.&nbsp; After all, 
								narrowing down the best product from a pool of three choices is certainly a lot 
								easier than narrowing down the best product from a pool of three hundred 
								choices.&nbsp; If the purchasing decision is tough to make, most people will 
								just give up.&nbsp; Likewise, if you complicate your life by inundating yourself 
								with too many choices, your subconscious mind will give up.</p>
							<p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 15px; ">
								The solution is to simplify.&nbsp; If you’re selling a product line, keep it 
								simple.&nbsp; And if you’re trying to make a decision about something in your 
								life, don’t waste all your time evaluating every last detail of every possible

								If it doesn’t work out, learn what you can from the experience, choose something 
								else and keep pressing forward.</p>

								Henry Ford once said, “Nothing is particularly hard if you divide it into small 
								pieces.” The same concept configured as a question:&nbsp; How do you eat an 
								elephant?&nbsp; Answer: One bite at a time.&nbsp; This philosophy holds true for 
								achieving your biggest goals.&nbsp; Making small, positive changes – eating a 
								little healthier, exercising a little, creating some small productive habits, 
								for example – is an amazing way to get excited about life and slowly reach the 
								level of success you aspire to.</p>
							<p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 15px; ">
								And if you start small, you don’t need a lot of motivation to get started 
								either.&nbsp; The simple act of getting started and doing something will give 
								you the momentum you need, and soon you’ll find yourself in a positive spiral of 
								changes – one building on the other.&nbsp; When I started doing this in my life,

								Start with just one activity, and make a plan for how you will deal with 
								troubles when they arise.&nbsp; For instance, if you’re trying to lose weight, 
								come up with a list of healthy snacks you can eat when you get the craving for 
								snacks.&nbsp; It will be hard in the beginning, but it will get easier.&nbsp; 
								And that’s the whole point.&nbsp; As your strength grows, you can take on bigger 
								challenges.</p>

								Successful people are not only working in their job/business, they are also 
								working<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span><strong

								their progress regularly.&nbsp; They track themselves against their goals and 
								clearly know what needs to be done to excel and accelerate.</p>
							<p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 15px; ">
								You can’t control what you don’t properly measure.&nbsp; If you track the wrong 
								things you’ll be completely blind to potential opportunities as they appear over 
								the horizon.&nbsp; Imagine if, while running a small business, you made it a 
								point to keep track of how many pencils and paperclips you used.&nbsp; Would 
								that make any sense?&nbsp; No!&nbsp; Because pencils and paperclips are not a 
								measure of what’s important for a business.&nbsp; Pencils and paperclips have no 
								bearing on income, customer satisfaction, market growth, etc.</p>
							<p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 15px; ">
								The proper approach is to figure out what your number one goal is and then track 
								the things that directly relate to achieving that goal.&nbsp; I recommend that 
								you take some time right now to identify your number one goal, identify the most 
								important things for you to keep track of, and then begin tracking them 
								immediately.&nbsp; On a weekly basis, plug the numbers into a spreadsheet and 
								use the data to create weekly or monthly trend graphs so you can visualize your 
								progress.&nbsp; Then fine-tune your actions to get those trends to grow in your 
								favor.</p>

							<p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 15px; ">
								Successful people concentrate on the positives – they look for the silver lining 
								in every situation.&nbsp; They know that it is their positivity that will take 
								them to greatness.&nbsp; If you want to be successful, you need to have a 
								positive outlook toward life.&nbsp; Life will test you again and again.&nbsp; If 
								you give in to internal negativity, you will never be able to achieve the marks 
								you have targeted.</p>
							<p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 15px; ">
								Remember, every mistake you make is progress.&nbsp; Mistakes teach you important 
								lessons.&nbsp; Every time you make one, you’re one step closer to your goal.&nbsp; 
								The only mistake that can truly hurt you is choosing to do nothing simply 
								because you’re too scared to make a mistake.</p>
							<p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 15px; ">
								So don’t hesitate – don’t doubt yourself!&nbsp; Don’t let your own negativity 
								sabotage you.&nbsp; Learn what you can and press forward.</p>

								11.&nbsp; They spend time with the right people.</h3>
							<p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 15px; ">
								Successful people associate with people who are likeminded, focused, and 
								supportive.&nbsp; They socialize with people who create energy when they enter 
								the room versus those who create energy when they leave.&nbsp; They reach out to 
								connected, influential individuals who are right for their dreams and goals.</p>
							<p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 15px; ">
								You are the sum of the people you spend the most time with.&nbsp; If you hang 
								with the wrong people, they will negatively affect you.&nbsp; But if you hang

								12.&nbsp; They maintain balance in their life.</h3>
							<p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 15px; ">
								If you ask most people to summarize what they want out of life they’ll shout out 
								a list of things like: ‘fall in love,’ ‘make money,’ ‘spend time with family,’ 
								‘find happiness,’ ‘achieve goals,’ etc.&nbsp; But sadly, a lot of people don’t 
								balance their life properly to achieve these things.&nbsp; Typically they’ll 
								achieve one or two of them while completely neglecting the rest.&nbsp; Let me 
								give you two examples:</p>
							<ul style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 15px 40px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); list-style-type: square; ">
								<li style="padding: 3px 0px; margin: 0px; ">I know an extremely savvy businesswoman 
									who made almost a million dollars online last year. Based on the success of her 
									business, every entrepreneur I know looks up to her.&nbsp; But guess what?&nbsp; A few 
									days ago, out of the blue, she told me that she’s depressed.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; “I’m burnt 
									out and lonely.&nbsp; I just haven’t taken enough time for myself lately, and I feel 
									like something is missing in my life,” she said.&nbsp; “Wow!” I thought.&nbsp; “One of the 
									most successful people I know doesn’t feel successful because she isn’t happy 
									with how she has balanced her life.”</li>
								<li style="padding: 3px 0px; margin: 0px; ">I also know a surfer who surfs all day, 
									every day on the beach in front of our condo complex in San Diego.&nbsp; He’s one of 
									the most lighthearted, optimistic guys I’ve ever met – usually smiling from ear 
									to ear.&nbsp; But he sleeps in a rusty van he co-owns with another surfer, and they 
									both frequently panhandle tourists for money.&nbsp; He has admitted to me that the 
									stress of making enough money to eat often keeps him up at night.&nbsp; So while I 
									can’t deny that this man seems happy most of the time, I wouldn’t classify his 
									life as a success story.</li>
							</ul>

								These are just two simple examples of imbalanced lifestyles that are holding 
								people back from their full potential.&nbsp; When you let your work life (or 
								social life, family life, etc.) consume you, and all your energy is focused in 
								that area, it’s extremely easy to lose your balance.&nbsp; While drive and focus 
								are important, if you’re going to get things done right, and be truly 
								successful, you need to balance the various dimensions of your life.&nbsp; 
								Completely neglecting one dimension for another only leads to long-term 
								frustration and stress.&nbsp; For some practical guidance on balancing your
